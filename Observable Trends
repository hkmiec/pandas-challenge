According to the data, the two highest percentages of players by age are those who are 20-24(44.79%) and those who are 15-19(18.58%). This suggests that the game is a really popular pasttime or hobby for adolescents or young adults, which makes sense since most people who utilize gaming streaming services such as Twitch are around those age ranges.

Another noticable trend is that Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the only in-game purchasable items that are above 10 in terms of purchase count(Final Critic: 13; Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm: 12). Thus, one might conclude that those items possess the most in-game benefits since they appear to be the more popular items to buy.

One last trend to note is that the percentage of male players is quite high(84.03%), whereas female players comprise a significnatly smaller proportion(14.06%). Perhaps this indicates that the genre of the game or certain elements of it appeal more to male players than female players.
